## What is MEAP? 
Mechatronic musical instruments, developed at VUW and elsewhere, have im- mense potential to deliver captivating audio-visual performances. Yet, this po- tential is limited by the divide between musiciansâ€™ technical expertise and the specialised knowledge currently needed to use these instruments. The aim of this project is to design, implement and evaluate MEAP (Mechatronic Ensemble Arrangement and Performance), a system which will bridge this gap between musicians and the mechatronic musical instruments, thus enabling musicians to fully explore the creative possibilities of these instruments. MEAP will be a system that is made up of a user-friendly VST plugin that interfaces with a server running syncronisation system, MechSync, allowing musicians to control mechatronic ensembles through their digital audio workstations (DAWs). It will simplify tasks such as setting up instruments, adjusting articulation parameters, and triggering performances. The result will be an intuitive tool that enhances mechatronic music creation, evaluated through musician feedback and technical testing.
